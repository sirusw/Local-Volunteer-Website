# Local-Volunteer-Website
This website intends to solve the problems of inefficient posting and registration of volunteer activities based on my own experiences during the 2021 Henan Flood 
happened in my city of Zhengzhou in China.

# Tech
- Google Maps API: posting and registering volunteering events directly on the map. 
- SSM (Spring, SpringMVC, Mybatis) framework
- Redis: login features
- Bootstrap: front-end styling
- MySQL

# Future
This project is developed within a short period of time. There are more features to be added in the future.
Also, within such short period of development time, planning and structuring were not perfect and some details had to be fixed and/or added during implementation.
In future projects, a more detailed and thorough planning should be done prior to implementation.
